This Capstone Project involves building an Automated EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) tool process and visualizing data based on column types using Python. The t of aims to simplify t that canre- pre-processing EDA process by automating the pre-processing steps and providing a comprehensive visualization dashboard for each column type. The tool will accept data in various formats, including CSV, Excel, and SOL databases. It will pre-process the data by identifying the data types of each column and performing appropriate pre-processing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features. and more. The tool will also provide options for feature selection and dimensionality reduction, making it easier to analyze large datasets. Once the pre-processing is corn ? the tool will generate a comprehensive visualization dashboard for each column type, including histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and more. The tool will use Python's Matplotlib. Seaborn. and 14 libraries to create interactive data visualizations that can be interfaced with implementation by the user. The project will involve designing a user-friendly command line â€¢ e.g. learning data pre-processing steps, developing visualization dashboards tch column types. and testing and debugging the tool to ensure its functionality.
