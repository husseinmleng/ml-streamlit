# This Capstone Project involves building an Automated EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
# tool process and visualizing data based on column types using Python. The t of aims to 
# simplify t that canre- pre-processing EDA process by automating the pre-processing steps 
# and providing a comprehensive visualization dashboard for each column type. The tool will
# accept data in various formats, including CSV, Excel, and SOL databases. It will pre-process
# the data by identifying the data types of each column and performing appropriate
# pre-processing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical features, 
# and scaling numerical features. and more. The tool will also provide options for feature 
# selection and dimensionality reduction, making it easier to analyze large datasets. 
# Once the pre-processing is corn ? the tool will generate a comprehensive visualization dashboard 
# for each column type, including histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and more. The tool will use 
# Python's Matplotlib. Seaborn. and 14 libraries to create interactive data visualizations that can
# be interfaced with implementation by the user. The project will involve designing a user-friendly command line 
# â€¢ e.g. learning data pre-processing steps, developing visualization dashboards tch column types. 
# and testing and debugging the tool to ensure its functionality.
